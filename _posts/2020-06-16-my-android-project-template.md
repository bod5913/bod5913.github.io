Have you ever experienced something like this:

1. Have a great idea for a weekend project
2. Create a new repository
3. Setup a proper CI to build your project
4. Setup a code formatter to enforce code-style
5. Start reading articles about `[tool name here]`â€¦
6. Weekend is over ðŸ˜…
7. Repeat

That's how a lot of side-projects of mine died in the past.

I love developer-tools such as **CIs** and **static-analysis** tools. They're crucial to deliver good quality code, and I can't imagine working without them. They're generally the first thing I set up before starting a new project.

Unfortunately, setting up such tools can be time-consuming, especially if you're not familiar with a specific tool and how to configure it.

That's why throughout the years I crafted my own **project templates**. They help me kick off a project if I have a new idea in mind, without having to spend time configuring everything from scratch.

Recently I've spent some time polishing them and open-sourcing some of them. They're now available for everyone to use with **Github templates** with just one click. 

Here you can find my Android App/Library template: 
[cortinico/kotlin-android-template](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template)

In this blog-post, I will walk you through the **steps I do before starting** an Android project and that you can find already applied in the linked template.

## 1. Format: ktlint

The clear choice I made in this template is to have it as a **100% Kotlin** template. I believe that in 2020 is safe to assume that you can start your new Android project with Kotlin only.

I generally don't start writing code without a **good formatter** to support me. Having several comments on your pull-requests about where to place parenthesis or extra white-spaces can be pretty annoying. A **formatter** can help you ship beautified code and avoid useless discussions. 

For Kotlin my preferred formatter is [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint). 

I use the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to integrate it into my build. With that, running:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```
will reformat the entire codebase.

Ktlint-gradle comes with other tasks that can help speed-up developer's productivity with **IntelliJ integration** and **pre-commit hooks**: 

```bash
# Will update IntelliJ/AndroidStudio reformat rules to
# match the ktlint style.
./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea

# Will set up a pre-commit hook that will run 
# reformat the code before a git commit.
./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook
```

If you happen to use [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html), ktlint will conveniently reformat also your `.gradle.kts` file.
  
## 2. Analyze: detekt & lint

Other than beautified, we want our code to be bug-free. 

That's where **static analyzers** can help spot bugs before the code goes to production. I always configure those two static analyzers on my projects:

- [**(Android) Lint**](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint): A language agnostic analyzer that will help you spot Android-specific bugs (e.g., unused resources or hard-coded text). 
- [**Detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt): A Kotlin specific analyzer that can help you find potential errors or anti-patterns in your Kotlin code.

Lint is available out of the box directly inside Android Studio. 

Detekt is instead a command-line tool and can be included in the build with a [Gradle plugin](https://detekt.github.io/detekt/groovydsl.html). 

Once [set up](https://detekt.github.io/detekt/groovydsl.html), invoking:
```bash
./gradlew detekt
``` 
is enough to run the static analyzer on the whole codebase. 

I personally find useful also the [detekt IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10761-detekt). It will run the detekt inspection directly inside Android Studio without having to run an extra task.

## 3. Manage dependencies: buildSrc

I prefer to use the [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) to write my build files. It comes with nice features such as auto-completion and semantic editing.

To manage **dependencies** I use the `buildSrc` included build. This allows organizing libraries and versions with a [Dependencies.kt](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/blob/master/buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt) file such as:

```kotlin
object Versions {
    const val APPCOMPAT = "1.1.0"
    const val CORE_KTX = "1.2.0"
    const val JUNIT = "4.13"
}
object SupportLibs {
    const val ANDROIDX_APPCOMPAT = "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:${Versions.APPCOMPAT}"
    const val ANDROIDX_CORE_KTX = "androidx.core:core-ktx:${Versions.CORE_KTX}"
}
object TestingLib {
    const val JUNIT = "junit:junit:${Versions.JUNIT}"
}
```

Those versions and coordinates are available to every build script in the project. Declaring a dependency is as easy as:

  <figcaption>Autocompleting dependencies with buildSrc and Kotlin DSL</figcaption>
</figure>

Moreover, I'm using the [Gradle Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to apply Gradle plugins instead of the old `apply: ` statement. 

Setting up a new module is a matter of just:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.library")
    kotlin("android")
}
```

The `buildscript {}` block is not needed anymore. Plugin versions are defined in the top-level [`build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/blob/73617f7f40b6d632b37a2d21b8b3b4cf01f59775/build.gradle.kts#L3-L10) file, while repositories are declared in the [`settings.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/blob/73617f7f40b6d632b37a2d21b8b3b4cf01f59775/settings.gradle.kts#L12-L17) file.

## 4. Build: Github Actions 

To build and test my project, I always set up a **continuous integration** environment. This allows running tests in isolation and ensuring consistent code formatting/static analysis on every commit.

I've tried several CI services in the last years, but recently I've migrated a lot of my projects to **Github Actions**.

In the template you can find two Github Actions workflows:

- [pre-merge](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) To build, test, run detekt & ktlint on all the modules of the project.
- [gradle-wrapper-validation](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/blob/master/.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) To validate the hash of the Gradle wrapper.

Those workflows will run automatically for every new Pull Request and for every push.

Github Actions integrates well with Github templates: when you create a new repo from my template, you will have a CI setup already running, and you don't need to set up extra services or create other accounts.

## 5. Conclusion: Maintain a template

Whenever I start a new project, I make sure to spend some time to **update my templates** to the latest market standards and tooling versions. I personally found project templates useful in several occasions:

- When kicking off a new project, they get you **started in some seconds** and let you prototype fast your idea. 
- When submitting bugreports to open-source projects, they let you create an empty project to easily showcase how to **reproduce a failure scenario**.
- When working on other projects, I often come back to my template to check how I configured a specific tool. They serve as **documentation** for my preferred setup.

I hope you found my template useful, and you get inspired to create your own. ðŸ’ª
