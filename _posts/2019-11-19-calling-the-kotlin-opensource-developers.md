Hi fellow Kotliners,

Today I'm really excited to announce that a project I had in mind for a while is becoming reality: **The Kotlin DevRoom at FOSDEM**! ðŸŽ‰

For the first time, Kotlin developers will be represented at the **biggest European open-source conference**, in Brussels on **February 1st and 2nd 2020**.

# About FOSDEM

From the official [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2020/about/):

<blockquote>
FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community,
for the community.<br/>
The goal is to provide free and open-source software developers and
communities a place to meet to:

<ul>
<li>get in touch with other developers and projects</li>
<li>be informed about the latest developments in the free software world</li>
<li>be informed about the latest developments in the open-source world</li>
<li>attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers</li>
<li>promote the development and benefits of free software and open-source solutions</li>
</ul>

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers
gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.

FOSDEM is really different from any other conference that you may have been to.

First, it's **non-commercial, volunteer-organized and free**!

I'm always amazed by the passion of everyone involved in FOSDEM organization. 
Every year the conference is a huge success, and this is just thanks to volunteers who spend their free time organizing it. Only in 2019, it was attended by **more than 8000 developers with over 700 sessions**.

Moreover, FOSDEM has something _special_ for me: it was the first international conference I've ever been to. Initially, I was hesitant about the content. With 700+ sessions it's hard to _crawl_ the agenda and find the best sessions. But then I realized that you don't go to FOSDEM **just** for the content.

FOSDEM is, first of all, an opportunity to **meet with the open-source community**. Every time I feel so much inspired by all the new connections, stories and projects that I found during the two days of the event. 

<!--At FOSDEM, you have the opportunity to meet other open source contributors that you probably met only virtually.--> 

Since then, FOSDEM is now a **fixed appointment in my agenda**. I can't think of a better way to start the conference season of a new year.

# About the Kotlin DevRoom

The Kotlin DevRoom is a _conference-within-a-conference_ that will allow Kotlin developers to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Kotlin usage in the FLOSS ecosystems.

The DevRoom will take place on **Sunday, the 2nd of February 2020**, from 9.00 AM to 5.00 PM at [ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522) in Brussels, Belgium.

Make sure to don't miss a full day of talks, demos, and interesting discussions about Kotlin! 

If you don't have an idea of what a DevRoom schedule will look like, you can check out the agenda of [one of last year's DevRooms](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/).

Finally, please note that FOSDEM is famous for having a **really high attendance rate**. Make sure to don't miss your seat as DevRooms tend to reach capacity pretty quickly.
