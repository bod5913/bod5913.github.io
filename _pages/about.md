I love to define myself a Linux lover. I am really passionate about open source and software development in general. I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge with others, and I can still remember the first talk about Linux when he was at High School, I never stopped since then.

Falling in love with the green droid felt just natural for me.

Currently I'm working as an Android Infrastructure Engineer at Yelp Inc, connecting millions of users with great local businesses worldwide. My main role is to develop libraries and tool for the Android Community here at Yelp. I'm committed to provide high quality material and I love to engage my colleagues into new technologies.

I love to create communities wherever I go. I always try to connect developers around me, and I love to offer new public speaking opportunities to everyone. I'm currently managing the GDG chapter in Pisa and the Kotlin User Group in Hamburg.

In my free time, I also love photography, hiking, and cake design.
