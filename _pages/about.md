# Hi there! I'm Nicola

I'm an **Android Engineer** a **Community Lover** and a **Traveller**.

## Android

I'm working as an Android Infrastructure Engineer at [<i class="fab fa-yelp"></i> Yelp](https://yelp.com/)
, connecting millions of users with great local businesses worldwide. My main role is to develop libraries and tool for the Android Community at Yelp. I'm committed to provide high quality material and I love to engage my colleagues into new technologies.

I have a serious thing for good design. I just want to take care of every single pixel on your screen, to deliver the best user experience to the final user.

I'm also in love with open source. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/cortinico) to see my projects and get in touch!

## Community & Public Speaking

I love to create communities wherever I go!

I really enjoy connecting developers around me, and I love to offer new public speaking opportunities to everyone. I'm currently managing:

* [The GDG (Google Developer Group) chapter in Pisa](https://gdgpisa.it/)
* [The Kotlin User Group in Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Hamburg/)

I also really enjoy public speaking and sharing my experiences. You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [talks page](/talks). Are you looking for speakers? I'm happy to travel and come to your meetup/conference! Just send me a [mail](mailto:corti.nico@gmail.com).

## Travels

In my free time, I travel! I really can't stop visiting new places and taking pictures. If you want to follow my travels, make sure to don't miss my [<i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>  Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/cortinico).

Drop me a message if you're around. I'll be more than happy to offer you an Espresso ☕️!
